## ⏳ Timeframe at a Glance (5 hrs/week)

*   **Year 1:** Focus on physics, math, and introductory circuits.
*   **Year 2:** Move on to real algorithms and running them on real qubits.
*   **Year 3:** Develop a domain-specific project that signals real-world value.

## ⚠️ Brutal Reality

> Most quantum computing jobs are research-heavy. Without a Master’s or PhD, your most likely path will be as a:
> *   Software engineer building QC frameworks.
> *   Developer creating hybrid applications (classical + quantum).
> *   Engineer integrating QC hardware into high-performance computing (HPC) workflows.

---

## ✅ Next Step

> Pick Qiskit → work through the textbook → run your first circuit → publish it this month.
>
> Ask for a "Quantum 30-day plan" if you want tight, actionable steps.
